# Problems

This is a list and record of all the problems that the user runs into when they RUN the deepdomain program.

## Recon

### Harvester

The following engines are not supported: {'waybackarchive', 'robtex', 'commoncrawl', 'gitlab', 'chaos', 'hudsonrock'}

### Shodan

Error: Please run "shodan init <api key>" before using this command

** In the README.md, have a section on what to do so that you can avoid this error. If you need to add an system enviornment variable, mention that.

### Subdomains

** NONE of the subdomain files contain ANY content or output; not even the main subdomains.md file.

## Scanning

### Network Discover

** The files inside of both detailed AND quick contain no output record. They have the commands ran, but not the outputs of them.

### Resolve

** The files inside of the resolve folder also DO NOT execute properly.

## Enumeration

## Vulnerable

** The nikto results are empty and the vulnerablities file is empty as well.



## **Conclusion**

It seems as though many of the commands themselves do NOT work properly given the program. Side note, when I try to run the program `sublist3r` on my Kali Linux machine, it says that it is not downloaded.
